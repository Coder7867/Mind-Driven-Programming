# Mind-Driven-Programming Engine

## Overview

**Mind-Driven Programming Engine** is an experimental interface that transforms natural thoughts and emotional context into executable logic. This project is designed to explore how humans might one day code with intention, feeling, and time-awarenessâ€”without traditional syntax.

## Demo
